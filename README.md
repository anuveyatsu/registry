Examples data registry and tooling

## Registry

Registry is maintained as [Tabular Data Package][tdp] with list of datasets in examples-list.csv.

[tdp]: http://frictionlessdata.io/guides/tabular-data-package/

To add a dataset add it to the `examples-list.csv`.

Discussion of proposals for new datasets and for incorporation of prepared datasets takes place in the [issues][].

To **propose a new dataset for inclusion**, please create a [new issue](https://github.com/datasets/registry/issues/new).
